# Backend Development Progress

This repository documents my learning journey and progress in backend development using **Laravel**.  
The focus of this repository is not on building a single final product, but on **tracking milestones, understanding concepts, and applying best practices** in backend engineering.

This repo serves as a personal learning log, technical reference, and proof of growth as a backend developer.
